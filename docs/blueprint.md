## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3490DC) to convey trust and professionalism. The concept of the night sky at twilight suggests the end of the work day and rest/renewal; it has a peaceful but also authoritative tone.
- Background color: Light gray (#F7FAFC), providing a clean and modern backdrop to make the content stand out.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#794BC4), used to highlight key elements and calls to action, drawing the user's attention to important sections. Like lightning, it's related to twilight, so its feel is high-energy and not chaotic.
- Body: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable style. Headings: 'Playfair' (serif) font pairing for a clear hierarchy and visual appeal.
- Clean, grid-based layout with clear sections for easy navigation. Use of white space to improve readability.
- Simple, professional icons to represent skills and technologies. Consistent style for all icons.
- Subtle transitions and animations to create a smooth and engaging user experience.
